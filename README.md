# Digital-Temperature-Sensor-DS18B20

In this project I purchased 2 DS18B20 digital temperature sensors.
  My goal was the get a working library that others in the class could utilize if they wanted.

The folder with DS18B20 holds the Arduino program that I used.

Other citings can be found throughout the Wiki.
