# Digital-Temperature-Sensor

In this project I purchased 2 DS18B20 digital temperature sensors.
My goal was the get a working library that others in the class could utilize if they wanted.


I made some minor adjustments to the code provided in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVOtoMqtrI.
There are also two linked githubs that had the libraries for the OneWire communication and code for multiple devices.
