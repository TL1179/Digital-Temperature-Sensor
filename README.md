# Digital-Temperature-Sensor-DS18B20

In this project I purchased 2 DS18B20 digital temperature sensors and tried to get them to show their readings on a OneWire protocol.
My goal was the get a working library that others in the class could utilize if they wanted.
Unfortunatly I was not able to get this library working for the chip.
I have citings and an explanation for what I was tyring to do to get the code working in the wiki.

The ds18b20 file is the Arduino program that I used.
