# Digital-Temperature-Sensor

In this project I purchased 2 DS18B20 digital temperature sensors.
My goal was the get a working library that others in the class could utilize if they wanted.


I made some minor adjustments to the code provided in from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVOtoMqtrI.
There are also two linked githubs that had the libraries for the OneWire communication and code for multiple devices.

After making the minor adjustments to the arduino code, I tried to understand the different components that I would need for the C implementation of it.

Obviously I needed to breakdown these two libraries to try and reprlicate it.

I also found this code that I tried to compare with to create the libraries https://github.com/nimaltd/ds18b20.
