# Digital-Temperature-Sensor-DS18B20

In this project I purchased 2 DS18B20 digital temperature sensors and tried to get them to show their readings on a OneWire protocol.
My goal was the get a working library that others in the class could utilize if they wanted.
Unfortunatly I was not able to get this working library for the chip.
I have citings and an explanation for how I was tyring to get the code to work in the wiki.

The folder with DS18B20 holds the Arduino program that I used.
